# C++ Arduino Robot

This repository contains a collection of Arduino scripts (in C++) to drive control a wheeled robot.
The current script is still work in progress, but it is simple to understand easly modified.

For the robot an Arduino board, 2 wheels and an Ultrasonic distance sensor are needed.

This script is a modified and simplified version of the one used by Nathan House as part of his Make project.
