# Guide to Arduino Robotics

This repository contains a collection of Arduino sketches used to control the wheeled robot illustrated in my upcoming book "Guide to Arduino Robotics".
As the book is still being written the sketches are 'work in progress', but they ar simple to understand easily modified. You can find the sketches in the folder 'book_code'.

For a very basic version of the wheeled robot you will need the following.
  * Arduino board - prefereably Arduino UNO
  * 2 Continuous rotating servos
  * 2 matching wheels
  * Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
  * Jumper wires to connect everything

To create a complete robot you will need more components such as 9 volt battery, 6 volt battery pack and a robot chassis with a third wheel or ball mount.
